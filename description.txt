Warhammer Items is a W.I.P. mod that aims to add some iconic artifacts from warhammer fantasy and some original complementary items and armor sets. This mod was made for fun and will most likely never be "finished" I am not sure if any update after this one will be coming to include content. I might try to keep it up to date with terraria though. I wouldn't say this mod is balanced, have fun!

These items are mainly based on TW3's depictions.

Current Items:

Tzeentchian Staff - a staff that shoots balls of tzeentchian fire
Khornate Pickaxe and Axe - tools made in the the blood god's image
Avelorn Bow - Lame bow I used to learn how to make a bow (will be improved later)
The Widowmaker - the sword of Khaine
Skryre Warplock Rifle - fires warpstone bullets
Warpstone Bullets - bounce off walls and make funny noises
Metamorphose - attacks launch eyeballs that home in on enemies and spew tzeentchian fire
Contortion - Bow that fires special arrows that spawn tendrils on hit

**ORE UPDATE**
Added new ore to be found!!
Use Chaotic Ore with Gold Ore to make Demonsteel and craft items from the mod :)
(adamantite pick required :p)
